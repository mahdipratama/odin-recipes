            <h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="directions">
            <ol>
              <li>
                Blend Sirloin chuck, brisket, and short rib ground beef mixes,
                then mix with some egg. I suggest you prepare this a day before
                grilling. Patty into 8 oz patties and then refrigerate for 24
                hours before using; this will help the patties stay together and
                won’t come apart as you grill them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure the grill is scorching before putting the patties on
                the grill. Now season the patties with salt and pepper and add a
                little oil. Make sure to roll the sides of the patties, so they
                get fully seasoned.
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure burgers are at room temperature 10 minutes before
                grilling them. Look for the hottest part on the grill and place
                the burger patties down on the grill. The secret is to move the
                patties as little as possible once you place the burger patties
                on the grill.
              </li>
              <li>
                Beginning preparing the hamburger buns as the burgers are
                cooking. Season buns with salt and pepper, and crisp them on
                both sides on the grill.
              </li>
              <li>
                Season the thick-sliced onions with salt and pepper, add some
                oil and place onions on the grill as the buns and burgers are
                cooking.
              </li>
              <li>
                Now start basting your patties by brushing them on each side
                just about two minutes before taking off the grill to add some
                more flavor. Grill each burger patties for 3 1/2 to 4 minutes on
                both sides.
              </li>
              <li>
                Thirty seconds before the patties come off the grill, you need
                to season the patties again, then add your jack cheese on top to
                melt while the burgers are still on the grill.
              </li>
              <li>
                Setup the Brioche buns; add the mustard mayo blend, lettuce, and
                tomatoes before taking the burger patties off the grill. First,
                you start by placing a tablespoon of mustard mayo blend on both
                sides of the top and bottom of the bun. Then gently fold the
                lettuce to fit onto the bun and press down on the lettuce,
                ensuring it stays folded.
              </li>

              <li>
                After the mustard mayo blend and lettuce, add a thick slice of
                tomato to the lettuce, season the tomato with salt and pepper,
                and dab more mayo on top.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add the burgers on each of the Pre-made dressed Brioche buns.
                Place grilled onions on top of each patty finish by placing the
                top bun.
